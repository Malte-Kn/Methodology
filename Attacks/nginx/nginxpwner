Target tab in Burp, select host, right click, copy all URLs in this host, copy to a file

cat urllist | unfurl paths | cut -d"/" -f2-3 | sort -u > tmp.txt

Or get the list of paths you already discovered in the application in some other way. Note: the paths should not start with /

Finally:

python3 opt/nginxpwner/nginxpwner.py https://example.com /tmp/pathlist
 
 
 or
 
python3 opt/nginxpwner/nginx-pwner-no-server-header.py https://example.com /tmp/pathlist
