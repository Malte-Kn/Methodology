Use SSRF to access Hidden files with:
	Host: localhost
	Origin: http://localhost
	Referer: http://localhost/

For s3/aws:
	aws.internal/169.254.169.254

If not allowed (403) maybe reverse proxy:
	try different content-types

If localhost not allowd DNS Rebind
	Tool to create host with low TTL for Rebind
	https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/rebinder.html
		A to 127.0.0.1 B to known/live IP

Use the Host andsee if SSRF protection is bypassed
